# Clinamen2

**Clinamen2** is a Python implementation of the CMA-ES algorithm designed with an emphasis on modularity and flexibility. It can be considered a spiritual successor of [Clinamen](https://gitlab.com/Marrigoni/clinamen/) written from scratch.

## General description

This repository contains releases of the software package described in the manuscript *Clinamen2: Versatile functional-style Python CMA-ES* by Ralf Wanzenböck, Florian Buchner, Péter Kovács, Georg K. H. Madsen and Jesús Carrete at the Institute of Materials Chemistry of TU Wien.

## Quick start

Example use cases are provided as scripts in the `examples/` subdirectory. For details on how to set up and run the examples please see the [GitHub pages](https://madsen-s-research-group.github.io/clinamen2-public-releases/source/getting_started.html).
